folders:
bin - additional files
labels - labeled data for each week
results - our results for each week
test_data - test data for each week
utils - any additional preprocessing tools

tests:
run test_correlation to see correlation of preprocessed data in with results.
run test_performance to see full performance report on split data or over test set.
test_models is used to check different learning modules.


Week 1 Updates:
-basic preprocessing to data
-currency and cancellation_code processing
-prediction based on "has cancelled in 7 to 45 days from order."

Week 2 Updates:
-changed prediction criteria. switched to a combination of classification (has cancelled)
and regression (expected time from order to cancellation). Read more on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57917374/how-to-combine-binary-classification-and-regression-problems

Week 3:
-Compare regression & classification models and choose an optimal one.
our estimator uses 'KNeighborsClassifier' and 'LinearRegression' which were chosen arbitrarily last week.
choose optimal parameters for models. consider probabilistic claxssifiers? (LDA...)
-Work on data preprocessing in agoda_cancellation_prediction.py - process_features. this is the primary function that
does the pre-processing. use tests/test_prediction to test correlation of generated features. Read more on:

-Add more stuff to do so we climb to the top of the leaderboard... go powerpuff!

Week 4:
-General guidelines: use split training sample to test. only test on previous weeks before submission to avoid
test set overfitting.

Week 5:
-Added several ensemble learning classifiers, need to test them.
-Alon: I made some experiments on 'class_and_reg' branch, that combine classification and regression models
to make predictions. it's pretty shit.

TODO:
-Learn on new modules, ensemble - bagging and the other thing. train over test data, and before submission test on prev. weeks.
-Improve feature pre-processing. learn the correlations and covariances, improve cancellation-code etc.
Consider removing some features or changing them.
-Better way to classify? Check the function "process_labels" in "agoda_cancellation_prediction" to see
the current label processing. for now, we mark a guest in the training set as 'canceled' if they canceled
their order on the 7-13th of the following month. this gives ~900 cancels.
-Something about maximizing F1-score that could be useful:
